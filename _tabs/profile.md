## Introduction 

Hi, I am Kangsan Kim from South Korea! 

I double majored in English Language and Literature and Software Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University.

I have a keen interest in artificial intelligence and data. Thus I've actively participated in AI projects to gain diverse experiences. I also have some experience in data science competitions. 

My primary areas of interest are Data Science and Data Engineering.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Ku, Byungjin, Kangsan Kim, and Jongpil Jeong. “Real-Time ISR-YOLOv4 Based Small Object Detection for Safe Shop Floor in Smart Factories.” Electronics 11, no. 15 (July 27, 2022): 2348. https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11152348.

:   Our team developed a model scaling technique based on YOLOv4 and used it  to create scaled-YOLOv4. The improved scaled-YOLOv4 demonstrated excellent performance through experimentation.

    I took on the role of managing and preprocessing the image data used in this project. Given the significant impact of data on model performance, there was a high need to curate large and high-quality datasets for training.

    To find suitable datasets, I reached out to companies and research labs, conducting thorough research. Once a construction dataset of sufficient quality was secured, I proceeded with labeling and organizing the data to train our model.



Programming Languages
:   **Python, SQL, Java, Kotlin, C, JavaScript, TypeScript**

:   Basic knowledge of x86 assembly, Next.js, JavaSpring, Node.js
